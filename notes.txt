I'm ready to program a mass backtester.

This program will test a binance-pybot strategy on multiple sets of historical price data.

I imagine it working like this:
- I will have a program called maba.py (mass backtester)
- maba.py has a class in it like binance-pybot's Instance class
- Inside the class will be a method for init and strat, which can be copied
from binance-pybot
- maba.py will be pointed to a data folder
- In the data folder will be several files containing historical price data
- Each file corresponds to a specific exchange, pair, timeframe, and period
- maba.py tests the strategy on each of the data files
- maba.py outputs the results to a text file

Then what I can do is tweak the strategy and retest it and compare how the tweak
affected the results. If I am running this test on a significant amount of
data sets then the effect of tweaking the strategy on the overall results is
more meaningful.

So here's the plan.
- First create a program that can get historical price data from Binance
- Get a couple of data files in the data folder
- Create the maba.py file and program it to do what I want
